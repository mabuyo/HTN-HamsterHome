# Hamster Home
A hamster cage you can interact with via a webpage that keeps track of a hamster's wellbeing (food, water, & health).

This project was created at Hack The North 2015 and finished as a Top 12 Finalist as well as Firebase API Winner. It's currently a work-in-progress as we rebuild the project using our own hardware parts.

## Inspiration
This project was built in loving memory of Ser Jaime Hammister. We were not at home often enough to keep track of his health. In an attempt to prolong the life of our future hamster and hamsters all over the world, we wanted to have a mobile way of checking up on them and taking care of them. Hence, Hamster Home!

## What it does
Hamster Home is a website that displays the health and wellbeing stats of a hamster in his home. It shows the water levels (full, half full, empty), how long it's been since food was last dispensed, and the distance the hamster has ran so far that day. It also allows you to dispense food for the hamster with the click of a button and keeps track of hamster activity. An infrared camera also streams live video to the website so you can check in on your hamster whenever you want!
